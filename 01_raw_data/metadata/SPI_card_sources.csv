SPI.DIM1.1.INDEX,Dimension 1.1: Data use by national legislature,Not included because of lack of established methodology. In principle it may be possible to utilize websites of national legislatures but this will require further work and assessment.,
SPI.DIM1.2.INDEX,Dimension 1.2: Data use by national executive branch,Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources (as used by PARIS21) but gaps in data across countries have prevented full adoption.,
SPI.DIM1.3.INDEX,Dimension 1.3: Data use by civil society,"Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources with good coverage, for example from social media but more data is required to help assess and allow for likely biases between and within countries.",
SPI.DIM1.4.INDEX,Dimension 1.4: Data use by academia,Not included because of lack of established methodology. We have not been able to find usable data sources with global coverage on which a new methodology could be developed.,
SPI.DIM1.5.INDEX,Dimension 1.5: Data use by international organizations,"Five measures of usefulness or reliability of country produced measures for international organizations have been included. First, on comparability of poverty estimates for the World Bank reporting on international poverty using Povcalnet. Second on usable surveys for statistics on child mortality for the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Third on accuracy of debt reporting as classified by the World Bank (Source: World Bank WDI metadata). Fourth, on availability of safely managed drinking water data for use by WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. Fifth, on labor force participation data for use by ILO. While these data sources provide only a partial coverage of data used by international organizations, they do provide an indication of the performance of the national statistical system.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.1.INDEX,Dimension 2.1: Data Releases,"SDDS/e-GDDS subscription. This indicator is based on whether the country subscribes to IMF SDDS+, SDDS, or e-GDDS standards. The source is the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. This is a reliable data source but we recognize that it is a proxy for the concept we are seeking to capture rather than a direct measurement.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.2.INDEX,Dimension 2.2: Online access,"ODIN Open Data Openness score (Crowell et al).

Scores range from 0-1. For more details, consult the ODIN technical documentation.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM2.3.INDEX,Dimension 2.3: Advisory/Analytical Services,Not included because of lack of established methodology. This could be a new indicator of the number of non-recurring products on NSO website (ad hoc/experimental rather than regular releases). The indicator is the number of products found. No established source exists for this indicator.,
SPI.DIM2.4.INDEX,Dimension 2.4: Data services,"NADA metadata. This indicator checks whether NADA microdata cataloging is available for surveys produced by NSO. NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Cores RDF metadata standards.

SPI.DIM3.1.INDEX,Dimension 3.1: Social Statistics,"Availability of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals 1-6, measured by an average score. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in MMeasuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."

SPI.DIM4.2.INDEX,Dimension 4.2: Administrative Data,"Availability of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) indicator. An ideal indicator for this dimension would include a score based on the density of administrative data available in sectors including social protection, education, labor, and health. However, social protection, education, health, and labor admin data indicators are not included because of lack of established methodology. While several promising sources for administrative data from the World Bank’s ASPIRE team, WHO, UNESCO, and ILO have been identified, these were not included due to incomplete coverage across countries. Further research and data collection effort would be needed to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of administrative data availability can be produced.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM4.3.INDEX,Dimension 4.3: Geospatial Data,Geospatial data available at 1st Admin Level. This data source from Open Data Watch focuses on data availability at the sub-national level and provides a partial understanding of a country’s ability to produce geospatial data.

Further work could improve the validity of this indicator and reduce the risk that countries may be incentivized to adopt only traditional standards and methods and neglect innovative solutions that may be more valid in the current context.","Unweighted average of indicators in this dimension.  Scores range from 0-1, with a score of 1 representing the best possible score."
SPI.DIM5.3.INDEX,Dimension 5.3: Skills,Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator drawing on PARIS21 indicators such as statistical society presence and data literacy could be developed and is an area of future work.,
SPI.DIM5.4.INDEX,Dimension 5.4: Partnerships,Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator based on textual analysis of NSS reports/websites for references to partner organizations could be developed. This is an area of future work.,
