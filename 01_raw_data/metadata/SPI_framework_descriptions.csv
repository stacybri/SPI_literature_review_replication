SPI.DIM1.1.INDEX,Dimension 1.1: Data use by national legislature,Data Use,Not included because of lack of established methodology. In principle it may be possible to utilize websites of national legislatures but this will require further work and assessment.
SPI.DIM1.2.INDEX,Dimension 1.2: Data use by national executive branch,Data Use,Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources (as used by PARIS21) but gaps in data across countries have prevented full adoption.
SPI.DIM1.3.INDEX,Dimension 1.3: Data use by civil society,Data Use,"Not included because of lack of established methodology. There are some usable data sources with good coverage, for example from social media but more data is required to help assess and allow for likely biases between and within countries."
SPI.DIM1.4.INDEX,Dimension 1.4: Data use by academia,Data Use,Not included because of lack of established methodology. We have not been able to find usable data sources with global coverage on which a new methodology could be developed.
SPI.DIM1.5.INDEX,Dimension 1.5: Data use by international organizations,Data Use,"Five measures of usefulness or reliability of country produced measures for international organizations have been included. First, on comparability of poverty estimates for the World Bank reporting on international poverty using Povcalnet. Second on usable surveys for statistics on child mortality for the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Third on accuracy of debt reporting as classified by the World Bank (Source: World Bank WDI metadata). Fourth, on availability of safely managed drinking water data for use by WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. Fifth, on labor force participation data for use by ILO. While these data sources provide only a partial coverage of data used by international organizations, they do provide an indication of the performance of the national statistical system."
SPI.DIM2.1.INDEX,Dimension 2.1: Data Releases,Data Services,"SDDS/e-GDDS subscription. This indicator is based on whether the country subscribes to IMF SDDS+, SDDS, or e-GDDS standards. The source is the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. This is a reliable data source but we recognize that it is a proxy for the concept we are seeking to capture rather than a direct measurement."
SPI.DIM2.2.INDEX,Dimension 2.2: Online access,Data Services,"ODIN Open Data Openness score (Crowell et al). This is a well-established data source with good country coverage, which scores countries based on whether indicators are available online in a format that is machine readable, in a non-proprietary format, downloadable, with metadata available and terms of use. Scores range from 0-1. For more details, consult the ODIN technical documentation."
SPI.DIM2.3.INDEX,Dimension 2.3: Advisory/Analytical Services,Data Services,Not included because of lack of established methodology. This could be a new indicator of the number of non-recurring products on NSO website (ad hoc/experimental rather than regular releases). The indicator is the number of products found. No established source exists for this indicator.
SPI.DIM2.4.INDEX,Dimension 2.4: Data services,Data Services,"NADA metadata. This indicator checks whether NADA microdata cataloging is available for surveys produced by NSO. NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Cores RDF metadata standards. Source: NSO websites."
SPI.DIM3.1.INDEX,Dimension 3.1: Social Statistics,Data Products,"Availability of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals 1-6, measured by an average score. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand."
SPI.DIM3.2.INDEX,Dimension 3.2: Economic Statistics,Data Products,"Availability of Goal 7-12 indicators, measured by an average score. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand."
SPI.DIM3.3.INDEX,Dimension 3.3: Environmental Statistics,Data Products,"Availability of Goal 13 & 15 indicators, measured by an average score. Goal 14 - Life on Water - is not included because land-locked countries do not report on these indicators. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand."
SPI.DIM3.4.INDEX,Dimension 3.4: Institutional Statistics,Data Products,"Availability of Goal 16-17 indicators measured by an average score. The primary data source is the UN SDG database. While this is a database with comprehensive coverage that all countries have signed up to, many countries are not yet submitting all their available national data. For this reason, scores for some countries thus may not fully capture their performance in calculating the indicators. For OECD countries, we supplement the UN SDG database with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand."
SPI.DIM4.1.INDEX,Dimension 4.1: Censuses and Surveys,Data Sources,"Availability of recent censuses and surveys covering broad areas. The following censuses and surveys are considered: Population & Housing census, Agriculture census, Business/establishment census, Household Survey on income/ consumption/ expenditure/ budget/ Integrated Survey, Agriculture survey, Labor Force Survey, Health/Demographic survey, Business/establishment survey. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata library."
SPI.DIM4.1.CEN.INDEX,Dimension 4.1: Censuses,Data Sources,"Availability of recent censuses covering broad areas. The following censuses are considered: Population & Housing census, Agriculture census, Business/establishment census. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata library."
SPI.DIM4.1.SVY.INDEX,Dimension 4.1: Surveys,Data Sources,"Availability of recent surveys covering broad areas. The following surveys are considered: Household Survey on income/ consumption/ expenditure/ budget/ Integrated Survey, Agriculture survey, Labor Force Survey, Health/Demographic survey, Business/establishment survey. Source: NSO websites, World Bank microdata library, ILO microdata library, IHSN microdata library."
SPI.DIM4.2.INDEX,Dimension 4.2: Administrative Data,Data Sources,"Availability of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) indicator. An ideal indicator for this dimension would include a score based on the density of administrative data available in sectors including social protection, education, labor, and health. However, social protection, education, health, and labor admin data indicators are not included because of lack of established methodology. While several promising sources for administrative data from the World Bank’s ASPIRE team, WHO, UNESCO, and ILO have been identified, these were not included due to incomplete coverage across countries. Further research and data collection effort would be needed to fill in this information, so that a more comprehensive picture of administrative data availability can be produced."
SPI.DIM4.3.INDEX,Dimension 4.3: Geospatial Data,Data Sources,Geospatial data available at 1st Admin Level. This data source from Open Data Watch focuses on data availability at the sub-national level and provides a partial understanding of a country’s ability to produce geospatial data. A research and data collection effort is needed to develop a more comprehensive global database of the availability of key geospatial indicators.
SPI.DIM4.4.INDEX,Dimension 4.4: Private/citizen generated data,Data Sources,"Not included because of lack of established methodology. Currently no comprehensive source exists to measure the use of private and citizen generated data in national statistical systems, and this should be another area where more data collection is needed by the international community."
SPI.DIM5.1.INDEX,Dimension 5.1: Legislation and governance,Data Infrastructure,"Not included because of lack of established methodology. Currently no comprehensive source exists to measure the use of private and citizen generated data in national statistical systems, and this should be another area where more data collection is needed by the international community."
SPI.DIM5.2.INDEX,Dimension 5.2: Standards and Methods,Data Infrastructure,"Average score for Standards and Methods indicators. Internationally accepted and recommended methodology, classifications and standards provide the basis for national statistical offices (NSOs) on data integration, facilitating data exchange and providing the foundation for the preparation of relevant statistical indicators.  The following methods and standards are considered:  System of national accounts in use, National Accounts base year, Classification of national industry, CPI base year, Classification of household consumption, Classification of status of employment, Central government accounting status, Compilation of government finance statistics, Compilation of monetary and financial statistics, Business process.  . Further work could improve the validity of this indicator and reduce the risk that countries may be incentivized to adopt only traditional standards and methods and neglect innovative solutions that may be more valid in the current context."
SPI.DIM5.3.INDEX,Dimension 5.3: Skills,Data Infrastructure,Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator drawing on PARIS21 indicators such as statistical society presence and data literacy could be developed and is an area of future work.
SPI.DIM5.4.INDEX,Dimension 5.4: Partnerships,Data Infrastructure,Not included because of lack of established methodology or suitable data sources. A new indicator based on textual analysis of NSS reports/websites for references to partner organizations could be developed. This is an area of future work.
SPI.DIM5.5.INDEX,Dimension 5.5: Finance,Data Infrastructure,"Included in dashboard, but not index because of insufficient country coverage and concerns that the indicator has biases that would lead to misleading incentives.  The indicator is based on PARIS21 SDG indicators (SDG 17.18.3 (national statistical plan that is fully funded and under implementation)."
SPI.INDEX,SPI Overall Score,,"The SPI overall score is a composite score measuing country performance across five pillars: data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure. The new Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) will replace the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI), which the World Bank has regularly published since 2004. Although the goals are the same, to offer a better tool to measure the statistical systems of countries, the new SPI framework has expanded into new areas including in the areas of data use, administrative data, geospatial data, data services, and data infrastructure. The SPI provides a framework that can help countries measure where they stand in several dimensions and offers an ambitious measurement agenda for the international community."
SPI.INDEX.PIL1,Pillar 1 - Data Use - Score,,"The data use overall score is a composite score measuring the demand side of the statistical system. The data use pillar is segmented by five types of users: (i) the legislature, (ii) the executive branch, (iii) civil society (including sub-national actors), (iv) academia and (v) international bodies. Each dimension would have associated indicators to measure performance. A mature system would score well across all dimensions whereas a less mature one would have weaker scores along certain dimensions. The gaps would give insights into prioritization among user groups and help answer questions as to why the existing services are not resulting in higher use of national statistics in a particular segment. Currently, the SPI only features indicators for one of the five dimensions of data use, which is data use by international organizations. Indicators on whether statistical systems are providing useful data to their national governments (legislature and executive branches), to civil society, and to academia are absent. Thus the dashboard does not yet assess if national statistical systems are meeting the data needs of a large swathe of users."
SPI.INDEX.PIL2,Pillar 2 - Data Services - Score,,"The data services pillar overall score is a composite indicator based on four dimensions of data services: (i) the quality of data releases, (ii) the richness and openness of online access, (iii) the effectiveness of advisory and analytical services related to statistics, and (iv) the availability and use of data access services such as secure microdata access. Advisory and analytical services might incorporate elements related to data stewardship services including input to national data strategies, advice on data ethics and calling out misuse of data in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics."
SPI.INDEX.PIL3,Pillar 3 - Data Products - Score,,"The data products overall score is a composite score measureing whether the country is able to produce relevant indicators, primarily related to SDGs. The data products (internal process) pillar is segmented by four topics and organized into (i) social, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental, and (iv) institutional dimensions using the typology of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This approach anchors the national statistical system’s performance around the essential data required to support the achievement of the 2030 global goals, and enables comparisons across countries so that a global view can be generated while enabling country specific emphasis to reflect the user needs of that country."
SPI.INDEX.PIL4,Pillar 4 - Data Sources - Score,,"The data sources overall score is a composity measure of whether countries have data available from the following sources: Censuses and surveys, administrative data, geospatial data, and private sector/citizen generated data. The data sources (input) pillar is segmented by four types of sources generated by (i) the statistical office (censuses and surveys), and sources accessed from elsewhere such as (ii) administrative data, (iii) geospatial data, and (iv) private sector data and citizen generated data. The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a country’s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. High scores should reflect the extent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For example, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of (and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). This type of linkage is inherent in the data cycle approach and can help highlight areas for investment required if country needs are to be met."
SPI.INDEX.PIL5,Pillar 5 - Data Infrastructure - Score,,"The data infrastructure pillar overall score measures the hard and soft infrastructure segments, itemizing essential cross cutting requirements for an effective statistical system. The segments are: (i) legislation and governance covering the existence of laws and a functioning institutional framework for the statistical system; (ii) standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts; (iii) skills including level of skills within the statistical system and among users (statistical literacy); (iv) partnerships reflecting the need for the statistical system to be inclusive and coherent; and (v) finance mobilized both domestically and from donors."
